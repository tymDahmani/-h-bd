## this simple code is an idea i've had to celebrate my great role model's birthday, and am working on applying it on a real code :3


# USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
after you clone the repo to your machine, change these vars in `the_msg.java`:
  * age (line 13)
  * mood (line 15)
  * status (line 16)
  * hope (line 17)

to suit your needs. (you can keep them tho ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯)

you can also edit the actions for each of these vars in the `you.java` file. (lines: 21, 26, 30, 34)
